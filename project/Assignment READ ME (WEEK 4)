Website Subject: Arduino Components Online Store
Planned Content:
The website will be used as an online platform to sell Arduino components, some of the components will include microcontrollers, sensors, modules, and accessories. It will use products listings with descriptions, images, and price. Adding to this, the website will include a blog section that will have tutorials and projects guides to help users learn how to use Arduino components. A contact page will be included for customers that have questions and support.
Reason for Choosing This Subject:
I currently teach STEM and I really enjoy it so this is the passion behind why I choose this subject. In my role as a STEM facilitator, I have had increasing demand for Arduino components from my students, hobbyists, and educators. This website will not only provide access to the components but also serve as a learning resource for those interested in building their own projects.
